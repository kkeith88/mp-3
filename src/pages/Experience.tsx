            I am a Software Engineer at The MITRE Corporation, where I specialize in building
            resilient, cross-platform applications designed for complex environments.
            With a background spanning .NET MAUI, Java Spring Boot, and React, I lead
            development efforts that bridge the gap between high-level architectural
            strategy and rapid, iterative execution.
